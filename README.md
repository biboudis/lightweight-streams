## Lightweight Streams for Java

This library employs the same pattern that the standard Java 8 library does but
without iterators/spliterators and is based on lambdas/continuation-passing
only. The programming model consists of combinators that wrap a source with a
datatype which implements the ```LStream``` interface. Any combinators that
are applied, effectively declare the transformations needed to be applied when
an eager combinator is met.

``` source - lazy - lazy - lazy - eager ```

The purpose of this library is to help with the study of the inlining decisions
that the JVM makes, when following the j.u.stream implementation strategy.

### Test
```shell 
# run unit tests
mvn -q test

# build benchmarks Ã¼ber-jar
mvn clean package -Dskiptests

# run benchmarks
java -XX:-TieredCompilation -jar target/microbenchmarks.jar -wi 15 -i 10 -f 1 -gc -tu ms ".*"
```
